"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The displayIntroduction function prints a welcome message to the player.
getPlayerChoice prompts the player to choose between entering a cave or following a forest path, then returns the chosen character ('A' or 'B').
handleChoice uses a switch statement to process the player's choice and display the corresponding scenario or an error message.
The main function orchestrates the flow of the game by calling these functions in sequence.
