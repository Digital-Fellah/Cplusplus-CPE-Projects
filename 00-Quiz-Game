"""
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program begins by defining two questions with their respective options and correct answers.
Each question is displayed sequentially with its options.
The user is prompted to enter their answer for each question.
After each answer, the program checks if the user's answer matches the correct answer and updates the score accordingly.
Finally, the program displays the user's final score out of the total number of questions.
