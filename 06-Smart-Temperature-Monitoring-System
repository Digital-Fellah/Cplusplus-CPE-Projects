EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program initializes a vector temperatures to store temperature readings.
Simulated temperature readings are added to the vector.
It uses the data() method to obtain a pointer (tempPtr) to the first element of the vector.
The program then dereferences the pointer to print out each sensor's temperature reading.
