EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The program starts by including necessary libraries (iostream for input-output operations and ctime for time-related functions).
It declares variables to store current time (currentHour, currentMinute) and alarm time (alarmHour, alarmMinute).
It retrieves the current time using time(0) and localtime(&now), then extracts hours and minutes.
The user is prompted to set the alarm time using cin.
It compares the current time with the set alarm time and displays appropriate messages based on whether they match.
